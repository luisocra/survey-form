# survey-form

I played a bit here and there with linear gradient and transparencies, learned how to use it combined with a background image to achieve a nice touch for the page. I learned how to use the select and textarea tags, along with the general styling of the form using divs and properly spacing with the correct label tag positioning. Also used radio and checkbox buttons for the first time and resized them a bit.
